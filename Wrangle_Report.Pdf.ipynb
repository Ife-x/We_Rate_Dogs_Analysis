    "I then applied for the Twitter developer elevated access which enabled me get additional data relating to favourite_count, retweet_Count and retweeted status directly from the twitter API.I then put the data for each tweet on a single line and saved the information in a text file called \"tweet-json.txt.\" The information for each tweet (tweet ID, retweet count, like count, and followers count) was obtained using the json library after the query was complete and all the data had been stored to the text file. I then read the text file line by line and appended the obtained information to an empty list.\n",
